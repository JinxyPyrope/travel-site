/*Be sure to use "rem" as your main way of scalling font size, padding or margin value.

rem - a value that makes elements size relative to the size of the page

Most webpages have 16 px as the main font size so the page will multiply the rem by the avergae size

So using 'rem' is better btter because as you carry your websites to most developers they'll know your size

/*The BEM strategy is used here to help use organize blacks with blocks with elements of their own and modifiers for later uses.
BEM = "Blocks, Elements, and Modifiers */

/*BEM Meanings:
1) Block - is an independent resuable part of the design
2) Element - belongs to a block and cannot be used outside othe block it beleongs to
3) Modifiers - Can be used on a block or an element to indicate a change to the default state of an object. */

/*BEM overview
- CSS selectors should target elemetns directly with classes, instrad of relying on type selectors, descendent selectors, and the cascade.
- Because we are limiting cascade we are free to move blocks around and reuse them throughout the page.
- Blocks can be nested inside other blocks.
- Identify patterns, and then create single-responsibility blocks.
- Makes the relationship between HTML and CSS clear */


/*DOing the "&" sign makes it so insteado putting each sperate class witht heir one class names
we place the "&" sign and place the rest of the words for each class title we gave making it so the code still goes through in a 
much easier fashon */
